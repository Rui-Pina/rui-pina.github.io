Reading Poems and Songs of Robert Burns was an interesting mix of charm and challenge. Burns has a way of writing that feels warm and familiar, even when the language isn’t. The Scottish dialect tripped me up more than once, and there were moments when I had to slow down to figure out what was being said. 


Burns’ writing often blends everyday life with deeper emotion, and even when I couldn’t catch every word immediately, it still was enjoyable.

A few pieces stood out as my favourites: “O Tibbie, I hae Seen the Day,” “In the Character of a Ruined Farmer,” “Here’s to thy Health,” “John Barleycorn,” and “O Once I Lov’d a Bonnie Lass.”
