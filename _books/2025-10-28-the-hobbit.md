Tolkien has a rare way of blending the warmth of home with the thrill of adventure. Through Bilbo's reluctant journey, we watch an ordinary soul find unexpected courage and cleverness amid dwarves, dragons, and riddling creatures in the dark.

What makes the book so good is how personal it feels beneath the fantasy. The fear of leaving comfort behind, the joy of friendship, and the quiet "pride" that comes from finding your own bravery.
