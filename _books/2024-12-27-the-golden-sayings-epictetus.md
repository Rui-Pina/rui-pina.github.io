Epictetus’s Golden Sayings belongs to the same Stoic tradition that made Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations famous. 

That said, while the wisdom is undeniably valuable, I found the book less groundbreaking than its reputation suggests. At times, the insights are profound; at others, they feel fragmented or repetitive. The modern hype surrounding Stoicism, especially in self-help circles, may also set expectations too high.

In the end, The Golden Sayings is best approached not as a flawless guide but as a window into how one person (in this case Epictetus) wrestled with the challenges of life.
