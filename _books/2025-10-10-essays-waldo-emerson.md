It's undeniable that Waldo had a profound influence on American idealism. However, I found his essays rather difficult to read. They're so densely packed with astute language and unusual phrasing that I often struggle to grasp his main point.

At the beginning of “First Visit to England,” Waldo writes: “I have, however, found writers superior to their books, and I cling to my first belief, that a strong head will dispose fast enough of these impediments, and give one the satisfaction of reality, the sense of having been met, and a larger horizon.”

I'm sure he would have been a fascinating person to talk to, but his writing simply doesn’t resonate with me the way a conversation with him likely would have.
