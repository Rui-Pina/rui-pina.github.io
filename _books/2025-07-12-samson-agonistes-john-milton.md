Samson Agonistes was the last of Milton's works I read. After the great epics, after the shorter poems, leaving aside only the divorce treatises and some scattered postal correspondence.  

Coming to it after Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained is a stark contrast. Whereas those works stretch across Heaven, Hell, and wilderness, this one stays enclosed. A drama of one broken man, blinded and betrayed, wrestling with despair. Milton frames it as a tragedy in the Greek mode, but it feels more intimate, more autobiographical. His Samson clearly echoing Milton's own blindness and isolation.  

What makes it compelling is precisely its refusal of grandeur. Samson is not triumphant until the very end, and even then his victory is bound up in destruction. Most of the play is simply suffering. The slow work of endurance, humiliation, waiting. And yet, in that weight of silence and lament, Milton again elevates the meek. Those who suffer, those who bend under burden but refuse to break entirely.  

It is not as expansive or dazzling as the epics, but it is a hard, stripped-down testament of endurance, and a fitting final voice from a poet who knew both greatness and ruin.
