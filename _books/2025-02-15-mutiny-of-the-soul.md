This book challenges the modern story of separation and invites us into a new narrative of interconnection.  

**My reflections:**  
Eisenstein’s vision resonates with the Fierce Community Initiative: the machine thrives on isolation, but communities thrive on solidarity. Reading this book was a reminder that cultural renewal is as important as economic change.
