John Milton’s Of Education (1644), often called Tractate of Education, is a concise but ambitious vision for reforming learning in England. He argued for a rigorous and practical education: not just book-learning, but training that united language, philosophy, science, and moral development to prepare citizens for active service in church and state.

My reflections:
This essay is important because it insists that education should shape the whole person, not just fill minds with rote knowledge. His central point holds: education should prepare people to live fully and contribute meaningfully, not simply to obey.
