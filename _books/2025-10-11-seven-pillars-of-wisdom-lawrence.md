 Seven Pillars of Wisdom shows how sharp and driven Lawrence was, both as a thinker and a leader.

He truly understood the men he fought for and carried the painful truth that their dream of freedom would not come true, as they ended up under British and French control instead, and he felt himself a fraud for it.

His writing pulls you straight into the desert, where you can feel the heat, the wind, "view" the Wadis, and the silence. Some moments are so vivid they stay with you, especially the haunting scene in the Turkish hospital in Damascus and the Tafas massacre.

This book is a powerful and deeply human book about courage, guilt, and the heavy cost of wisdom.
