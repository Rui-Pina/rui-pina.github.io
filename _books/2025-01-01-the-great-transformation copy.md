This book explores how market economies emerged and the social costs that followed.  
It is a foundational text for understanding why communities must reclaim control over economic life.  

**My reflections:**  
Polanyi shows us that markets are not “natural” but constructed — and when they dominate, they tear apart the fabric of society. This directly informs our commitment to building cooperatives and community-led enterprises.
