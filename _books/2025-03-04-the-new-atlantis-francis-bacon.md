I really loved this book, even though many dismiss it or find it unappealing, to me it’s one of Bacon’s most imaginative and profound works. It’s not just a text on science; it’s a dream of community. Discovery, learning, and collective welfare come together.

Bacon imagined a society where knowledge was not hoarded but shared, where institutions existed to serve people rather than exploit them. That spirit, of building a cooperative and dignified order, mirrors our own vision. The New Atlantis reminds us that we need not only critique the world we live in, but also dare to imagine the one we want to build.
