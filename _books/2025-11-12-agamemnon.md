Instead of reading it, I decided to watch a play instead—the BBC’s adaptation of *Agamemnon*. Greek classics often come alive best through performance, and this one really did.

Seeing it acted out helped me understand the story in a way the text alone doesn’t quite manage. The atmosphere felt heavy and tense, and the actors made the emotions of pride, guilt, and fate very clear without overdoing it. It was easy to see why this play has lasted so long.

The adaptation also highlighted the play’s strong anti-war message. It shows how violence doesn’t just end on the battlefield. It comes home with the soldiers, shaping families, cities, and the future itself. It reminded me that Aeschylus himself fought in real battles, and the story feels like a warning about the cost of celebrating victory without acknowledging its consequences.

It was a strong and memorable performance. It gave me a better sense of the story and left me thinking about it afterward.
