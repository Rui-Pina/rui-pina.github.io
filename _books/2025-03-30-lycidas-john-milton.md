This is a poem worth savoring—as nearly all great poetry is—line by line, unpacking its meanings and allusions. The repetition of sounds like the o’s evoke mourning, while the softer l’s lend lightness, each sound portrays the feelings of this passionate poem.

I spent two hours studying this relatively short poem and the time flew by. What an extraordinary work this is—not just a masterpiece of elegy, but a profound ode to friendship, loss, and artistic legacy.
