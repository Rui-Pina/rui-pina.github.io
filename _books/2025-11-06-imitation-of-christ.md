I can see why it has inspired people for centuries. There’s a real sincerity in its call to let go of pride and worldly distraction. Some passages are sharp in their simplicity, like they were written straight from the heart.

But for me, it was a hard book to connect with. Its focus on self-denial and the rejection of ordinary joys felt distant, almost severe. I admire its conviction, but it left me more thoughtful than moved.

Also I felt it talked too little about imitating Christ.
