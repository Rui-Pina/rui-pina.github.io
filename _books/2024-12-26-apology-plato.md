Plato’s Apology is one of the most powerful works of ancient philosophy, presenting Socrates’ defense speech during his trial in Athens. Socrates refuses to compromise his principles, even under threat of death, making the dialogue a lasting statement on integrity and moral courage.

What stands out is the clarity and conviction with which Socrates speaks. For me, this text feels timeless. It forces us to ask: what are we willing to risk for truth, and how far will we go to live authentically?
