If Apology shows Socrates’ fearless defense before the jury, Crito reveals the quieter but equally weighty moment that follows: his refusal to escape prison even when offered the chance. In this dialogue, Socrates argues that justice cannot be served by breaking the law, even if the law has wronged him. His loyalty to principle, and to the social fabric of the city, outweighs the instinct for self-preservation.

What makes Crito striking is its tension between personal friendship and public duty. Crito pleas humanly. He does not want to lose his friend. Yet Socrates’ response elevates the discussion, reminding us that philosophy demands consistency between words and deeds. His decision may be painful, but it is also profoundly coherent.

To me, Crito stands as a meditation on responsibility: to one’s community, to one’s values, and to the truth itself.
