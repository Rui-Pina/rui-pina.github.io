I found the autobiographical parts especially moving and courageous. It's rare to see someone from that time write so openly about their own weaknesses, especially in the Roman Empire, where people were expected to be tough. 

His journey from ambition and desire toward faith feels deeply human, and at times I saw parts of my own life reflected there. The tension between what we want and what we know is right.

Some of his theological reflections are fascinating, especially the way he questions time, memory, and the nature of God. But a few sections felt too abstract for me. That’s not really the author's fault, it’s mine. I just couldn’t always follow his reasoning.
