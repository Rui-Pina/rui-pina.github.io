If Paradise Lost is Milton’s cathedral, then Paradise Regained is his chapel. Smaller, quieter, yet no less profound.  

Where the first epic dazzles with vast battles, burning rhetoric, and cosmic scale, this sequel withdraws into the Gospel story of Jesus being tempted by Satan in the desert. A confrontation of words rather than armies. Here the hero is Christ himself, not in thunder or wrath, but in patience. His refusal to be moved, to seize glory on Satan’s terms, is where his strength lies.  

This is Milton’s consistent inversion we see throughout his books. The meek of spirit are not crushed but revealed as unshakable. Just as Abdiel stood alone among rebels in Paradise Lost, Christ withstands temptation. Victory comes not in conquest but in restraint.  

It may lack the grandeur of the earlier work, but the quiet intensity of Paradise Regained makes it unforgettable. If the first poem shows us the fall of the so called mighty, this one shows us the might of the meek.
