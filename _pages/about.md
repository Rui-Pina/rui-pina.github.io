I’m **Rui Pina**, and I believe technology should serve communities as much as it serves corporations. I started the Fierce Community Initiative because I realized that the skills I use to build systems could also help people **take back control over the essentials of daily life**.  

This initiative is my lifelong commitment. It brings together practical projects and shared values, with the goal of creating systems where communities **own, manage, and benefit from the resources they depend on**.  

Through this work, I’ve learned that resilient communities are not built on tools alone—they are built on trust, transparency, and a shared commitment to **fairness and dignity**. This site is a place to share projects, reflections, and practical guides so others can adapt these ideas to their own communities.  

The Fierce Community Initiative is about one clear purpose: to **restore dignity, strengthen communities, and build a future that belongs to all of us**.
