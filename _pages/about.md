Hi, I’m **Rui Pina**, a software engineer from Porto, Portugal, originally born in Luxembourg.  
I am passionate in going from idealism to practicism. I build reliable, scalable systems and explore new technologies while doing it.  

This site is a place where I share my work, projects, and professional interests. It also serves as a hub for resources, writing, and anything else I find worth sharing.

A little about this website
======
This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which makes it easy to update and maintain. I’ll be using it to highlight projects, publications, and other professional milestones.  

Over time, I’ll also include blog posts, notes on software engineering practices, and maybe some thoughts on technology, tools, and ideas that inspire me.

Generic stuff
======
- I enjoy solving complex problems and turning them into elegant solutions.  
- I believe in lifelong learning and continuously improving my skills.  
- Collaboration and sharing knowledge are essential values in my work.  
- Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring culture, travel, and new perspectives.  

Thanks for stopping by! Stay tuned as I continue to update this space.
