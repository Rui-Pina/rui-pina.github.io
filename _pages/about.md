I’m **Rui Pina**, a software engineer who believes that technology should empower communities, not just corporations. I started the Fierce Community Initiative because I realized that the same skills I use to build systems could help people **regain control over the essentials of life**: food, housing, work, and energy.  

This initiative combines practical projects with shared values. From NutRush to housing programs and worker dignity initiatives, our goal is to create systems where communities **own, manage, and benefit from the resources they rely on**.  

Along the way, I’ve learned that building resilient communities takes more than tools—it takes trust, transparency, and a commitment to **shared principles of fairness and dignity**. This site is a space to share initiatives, reflections, and practical guides, so others can adapt what we’ve learned to their own communities.  

The Fierce Community Initiative isn’t a one-person effort—it’s a call to action: **reclaim power, restore dignity, and rebuild the communities we all deserve.**
